      <h2 class="card-title">Our Story</h2>
      <div class="card-content">
        <p>
          LibNexa was developed by three passionate final-year students from the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering (ETCE) at Falakata Polytechnic: <strong>Kunal Das</strong>, <strong>Ashim Bakshi</strong>, and <strong>Arindam Das</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by library staff in managing records manually, we recognized an opportunity to make a real difference. What started as a final-year project quickly evolved into a full-featured library management system designed to address real-world problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through countless hours of development, testing, and refinement, we've created a solution that combines robust functionality with an intuitive user interface. LibNexa represents our commitment to leveraging technology for educational advancement.
